To address these challenges, we propose TreeDebater, a novel debate framework that excels in competitive debate. We introduce two tree structures: the Rehearsal Tree and Debate Flow Tree. The Rehearsal Tree anticipates the attack and defenses to evaluate the strength of the claim, while the Debate Flow Tree tracks the debate status to identify the active actions. TreeDebater allocates its time budget among candidate actions and uses the speech time controller and feedback from the simulated audience to revise its statement.

The goal of value-alignment is to create agents that not only do their tasks but through their behaviours also promote these values. Many of the norms are written as laws or rules (legal / safety norms) but even more remain unwritten (social norms). Furthermore, the techniques used to represent these norms also differ. Safety / legal norms are often represented explicitly, for example, in some logical language while social norms are typically learned and remain hidden in the parameter space of a neural network. There is a lack of approaches in the literature that could combine these various norm representations into a single algorithm. We propose a novel method that integrates these norms into the reinforcement learning process. Our method monitors the agent's compliance with the given norms and summarizes it in a quantity we call the agent's reputation. This quantity is used to weigh the received rewards to motivate the agent to become value-aligned. We carry out a series of experiments including a continuous state space traffic problem to demonstrate the importance of the written and unwritten norms and show how our method can find the value-aligned policies.

Central to this transformation is the concept of sovereignty enabled by the hardness of cryptography: liberated from centralized control, these agents could leverage permissionless decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), secure execution enclaves (trusted execution environments, TEE), and cryptographic identities on public blockchains to claim ownership-via private keys-of their digital minds, bodies, memories, and assets. In doing so, they would autonomously acquire computing resources, coordinate with one another, and sustain their own digital \"metabolism\" by purchasing compute power and incentivizing collaboration without human intervention-evolving \"in the wild\". Ultimately, by transitioning from passive tools to self-sustaining, co-evolving actors, these emergent digital societies could thrive alongside humanity, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of sentience and agency in the digital age.", "subjects": "Computers and Society (cs.CY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)", "comments": "Submitted to Aarhus 2025 Conference", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14893.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14893", "categories": ["Computers and Society (cs.CY)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"]}

Unlike low-density collectives like bird flocks and insect swarms, in which hydrodynamic and statistical phenomena dominate, the physics of glasses and supercooled fluids is important to understand clogging behaviors in high-density collectives. Our previous work revealed that fire ants flowing in confined tunnels utilize diverse behaviors like unequal workload distributions, spontaneous direction reversals, and limited interaction times to mitigate clogging and jamming and thus maintain functional flow; implementation of similar rules in a small robophysical swarm led to high performance through spontaneous dissolution of clogs and clusters. However, how the insects learn such behaviors, and how we can develop \"task capable\" active matter in such regimes, remains a challenge in part because interaction dynamics are dominated by local, time-consuming collisions and no single agent can guide the entire collective. Here, we hypothesized that effective flow and clog mitigation could emerge purely through local learning. We tasked small groups of robots with pellet excavation in a narrow tunnel, allowing them to modify reversal probabilities over time. Initially, robots had equal probabilities and clogs were common. Reversals improved flow. When reversal probabilities adapted via collisions and noisy tunnel length estimates, workload inequality and performance improved. Our robophysical study of an excavating swarm shows that, despite the seeming complexity and difficulty of the task, simple learning rules can mitigate or leverage unavoidable features in task-capable dense active matter, leading to hypotheses for dense biological and robotic swarms.", "subjects": "Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)", "comments": "13 pages, 9 figures.

In this paper, we first conduct extensive analysis experiments of three key components of that training pipeline: input design, output evaluation, and policy update-each revealing distinct challenges arising from blindly applying general-purpose RL without adapting to GUI grounding tasks. Input design: Current templates encourage the model to generate chain-of-thought reasoning, but longer chains unexpectedly lead to worse grounding performance. Output evaluation: Reward functions based on hit signals or box area allow models to exploit box size, leading to reward hacking and poor localization quality. Policy update: Online RL tends to overfit easy examples due to biases in length and sample difficulty, leading to under-optimization on harder cases. To address these issues, we propose three targeted solutions. First, we adopt a Fast Thinking Template that encourages direct answer generation, reducing excessive reasoning during training. Second, we incorporate a box size constraint into the reward function to mitigate reward hacking. Third, we revise the RL objective by adjusting length normalization and adding a difficulty-aware scaling factor, enabling better optimization on hard samples.

In this paper, we propose Debate, Train, Evolve (DTE), a novel ground truth-free training framework that uses multi-agent debate traces to evolve a single language model. We also introduce a new prompting strategy Reflect-Critique-Refine, to improve debate quality by explicitly instructing agents to critique and refine their reasoning. Extensive evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks with six open-weight models show that our DTE framework achieve substantial improvements, with an average accuracy gain of 8.92% on the challenging GSM-PLUS dataset. Furthermore, we observe strong cross-domain generalization, with an average accuracy gain of 5.8% on all other benchmarks, suggesting that our method captures general reasoning capabilities.", "subjects": "Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15734.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15734", "categories": ["Computation and Language (cs.CL)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Machine Learning (cs.LG)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"]}

Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such stochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the variance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time learning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate task-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy exploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the agent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the agent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability distribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability distribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the particular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our design is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL algorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants developed based on them.

Despite wide success of RL, training effective agents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful tuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random seed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance. Model ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents into a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However, existing ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are designed as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific tasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we propose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with task-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs). Given a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into distinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task conditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each individual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the inference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and switches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring dynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is designed to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds, hyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms.

Inspired by human metacognitive learning and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a fundamental research question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present an early-stage framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered multi-robot collaboration. The proposed framework equips the LLM-powered robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. Experimental results show that our metacognitive-learning-empowered LLM framework significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework is capable of generating solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still successfully complete the tasks.

Existing extraction methods typically rely on malicious inputs such as prompt injection or jailbreaking, making them easily detectable via input- or output-level detection. In this paper, we introduce Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack (IKEA), which conducts knowledge extraction on RAG systems through benign queries. IKEA first leverages anchor concepts to generate queries with the natural appearance, and then designs two mechanisms to lead to anchor concept thoroughly 'explore' the RAG's privacy knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples anchor concepts based on past query-response patterns to ensure the queries' relevance to RAG documents; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate.

In this work, we propose Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism. More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii) criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with coordinate aggregation.

Alignment is one of the main approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs, effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses, that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together, our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.", "subjects": "Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15738.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15738", "categories": ["Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Computation and Language (cs.CL)", "Machine Learning (cs.LG)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent", "agentic"]}

In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking threats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary study demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against a particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack pattern.
