Existing vision-only methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU, respectively.

Bridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and time-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between high-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing manners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose A2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable algorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework that enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common hallucination issues in LLM-generated code.

If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do language agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable. Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when the search space is artificially restricted.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals with actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven decisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual (i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world applications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing outcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the inherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact and compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple recourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction as a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided by both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse costs, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap between individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a three-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal capacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware optimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs. Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that our framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve near-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

Structurally, we construct an entity hypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained passages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared entities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates fine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via hypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which further refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to obtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the LLM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in QA performance, and achieves a 6$\\times$ speedup in retrieval efficiency.", "subjects": "Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11247.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11247", "categories": ["Computation and Language (cs.CL)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["@RAG"], "AI": {"tldr": "提出了一种名为HGRAG的新型检索增强生成方法，用于多跳问答任务，通过超图实现结构和语义信息的跨粒度整合。", "motivation": "解决传统检索增强生成方法在多跳问答任务中忽视分散知识间结构关联的问题，以及图检索增强生成方法过度依赖结构信息的问题。", "method": "构建实体超图，其中细粒度实体作为节点，粗粒度段落作为超边，通过共享实体建立知识关联；设计超图检索方法，通过超图扩散整合细粒度实体相似性和粗粒度段落相似性；采用检索增强模块进一步优化检索结果。", "result": "在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在问答性能上优于现有最先进方法，并实现了检索效率的6倍加速。", "conclusion": "HGRAG方法通过超图实现了结构和语义信息的有效整合，显著提高了多跳问答任务的性能和效率。"}}

Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and maintaining computational efficiency.

The driving agent predicts initial driving trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning decisions.

Conventional explainable artificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the upstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether insights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds explanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those explanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up, learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a single taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts, data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs; our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in theories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and findings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that make explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive taxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and enabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We further demonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestrate diverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts into stakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers and domain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles, this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-world projects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel, end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AI deployment.", "subjects": "Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": "Preprint.
