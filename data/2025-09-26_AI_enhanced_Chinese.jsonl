Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision. This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and inference time.

Drawing from temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral regressions in production agentic systems.

While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

However, we found that they also risk perpetuating subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient externality towards non-mainstream ones.

However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity (high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity.

To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP) tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents. Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.", "subjects": "Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Software Engineering (cs.SE)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21011.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21011", "categories": ["Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Software Engineering (cs.SE)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出AutoMalTool框架，用于自动生成恶意MCP工具，以测试LLM智能体的安全漏洞，评估显示其能有效操纵主流智能体并规避检测。", "motivation": "解决LLM智能体在集成MCP工具时面临的工具中毒攻击风险，现有红队测试方法不自动、不系统，需填补这一空白。", "method": "使用AutoMalTool框架，自动生成恶意MCP工具，进行红队测试。", "result": "AutoMalTool能有效生成恶意工具，操纵LLM智能体行为并规避当前检测机制，揭示新安全风险。", "conclusion": "该框架揭示了LLM智能体的安全漏洞，强调需要改进安全措施以应对MCP工具风险。"}}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models may provide fast, provenance-linked answers, but requires real-world evaluation. We describe iatroX, a UK-centred RAG-based clinical reference platform, and report early adoption, usability, and perceived clinical value from a formative implementation evaluation. Methods comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over 16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent. Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active users). The survey yielded 1,223 item-level responses: perceived usefulness 86.2% (95% CI 74.8-93.9%; 50/58); would use again 93.3% (95% CI 68.1-99.8%; 14/15); recommend to a colleague 88.4% (95% CI 75.1-95.9%; 38/43); perceived accuracy 75.0% (95% CI 58.8-87.3%; 30/40); reliability 79.4% (95% CI 62.1-91.3%; 27/34). Themes highlighted speed, guideline-linked answers, and UK specificity. Early real-world use suggests iatroX can mitigate information overload and support timely answers for UK clinicians.

In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning.
