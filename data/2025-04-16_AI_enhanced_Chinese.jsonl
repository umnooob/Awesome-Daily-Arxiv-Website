This paper presents a novel Visual RAG pipeline that combines the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for few-shot FGC.

Kim", "Youngjae Kim"], "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.", "subjects": "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11765.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11765", "categories": ["Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["@RAG"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种名为Shared RAG-DCache的磁盘键值缓存管理系统，旨在减少RAG增强的大型语言模型（LLMs）推理时的首次令牌时间（TTFT），通过共享磁盘KV缓存和多实例管理，提高了吞吐量和降低了延迟。", "motivation": "随着输入上下文长度和模型大小的增加，大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理延迟问题日益严重，特别是采用检索增强生成（RAG）技术时，输入令牌数量的显著增加导致预填充阶段的计算开销大幅上升，延长了首次令牌时间（TTFT）。", "method": "提出了一种利用磁盘键值（KV）缓存减轻预填充阶段计算负担的方法，并引入了名为Shared RAG-DCache的磁盘共享KV缓存管理系统，该系统通过利用RAG中用户查询相关文档的局部性和LLM推理服务中的排队延迟，主动生成和存储查询相关文档的磁盘KV缓存，并在多个LLM实例间共享以提高推理性能。", "result": "在配备2个GPU和1个CPU的单台主机上进行的实验中，Shared RAG-DCache实现了吞吐量15~71%的提升和延迟12~65%的降低，具体效果取决于资源配置。", "conclusion": "Shared RAG-DCache系统通过优化系统配置和共享磁盘KV缓存，有效提高了RAG增强的LLMs在多实例服务环境下的推理性能，为减少TTFT和提高系统效率提供了可行的解决方案。"}}

Heath"], "abstract": "Motivated by collaborative reinforcement learning (RL) and optimization with time-correlated data, we study a generic federated stochastic approximation problem involving $M$ agents, where each agent is characterized by an agent-specific (potentially nonlinear) local operator. The goal is for the agents to communicate intermittently via a server to find the root of the average of the agents' local operators. The generality of our setting stems from allowing for (i) Markovian data at each agent and (ii) heterogeneity in the roots of the agents' local operators. The limited recent work that has accounted for both these features in a federated setting fails to guarantee convergence to the desired point or to show any benefit of collaboration; furthermore, they rely on projection steps in their algorithms to guarantee bounded iterates. Our work overcomes each of these limitations. We develop a novel algorithm titled \\texttt{FedHSA}, and prove that it guarantees convergence to the correct point, while enjoying an $M$-fold linear speedup in sample-complexity due to collaboration. To our knowledge, \\emph{this is the first finite-time result of its kind}, and establishing it (without relying on a projection step) entails a fairly intricate argument that accounts for the interplay between complex temporal correlations due to Markovian sampling, multiple local steps to save communication, and the drift-effects induced by heterogeneous local operators.

This knowledge goes beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions, understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout, and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal approach against a non-causal baseline.
