In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent, incorporating a \"rewriting-resolution-review-revision\" logical chain via three reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer, respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions.

Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy, velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g., -430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop, real-world contexts.

Hierarchical reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware, GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their respective coordination strategies.

In this work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles, including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning, (2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3) advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents. Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of deep learning-based medical image segmentation and aim to inspire future innovation.

Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent, an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process, effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root cause localization in complex microservice environments.", "subjects": "Software Engineering (cs.SE); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20370.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20370", "categories": ["Software Engineering (cs.SE)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出RCLAgent，一种基于多智能体递归思维框架的自适应微服务系统根因定位方法，通过整合多源数据和工具辅助分析，在单次请求中实现高效精准的根因定位，优于现有方法。", "motivation": "解决微服务系统因复杂性和频繁故障导致的根因定位问题，现有方法依赖预定义模式或缺乏可解释性，无法适应动态环境。", "method": "采用多智能体递归思维框架，结合递归策略指导大型语言模型推理，整合多智能体数据和工具分析。", "result": "在公开数据集上，RCLAgent仅用单次请求就实现卓越性能，超越依赖多次请求聚合的最先进方法。", "conclusion": "RCLAgent显著提升微服务系统根因定位的效率和精度，具有实际应用价值。"}}

This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer architecture: \\textbf{\\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \\textbf{\\textit{Prompt Orchestration Layer}}, and \\textbf{\\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer: directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics, and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of collaborative strategies (\\emph{Retain}, \\emph{Translate}, \\emph{Integrate}, and \\emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring. Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing.

Traditional methods, such as static program analysis, face significant challenges related to scalability, adaptability, and high false-positive and false-negative rates. AI-driven approaches, particularly those using machine learning and deep learning models, show promise but are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of training data. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to automatically introduce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++ codebases to generate datasets. The proposed approach coordinates multiple AI agents that simulate expert reasoning, along with function agents and traditional code analysis tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation for contextual grounding and employs Low-Rank approximation of weights for efficient model fine-tuning.
