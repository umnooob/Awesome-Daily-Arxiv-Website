First, to achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off. Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving collaborative training of various routes.

However, many real-world applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs -- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval effectiveness, which varies greatly by task.

The proposed agent, incorporating a \"rewriting-resolution-review-revision\" logical chain via three reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer, respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis problems.

Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy, velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g., -430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions).

Contextual Markov Decision Processes (cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination (DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines, often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.", "subjects": "Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": "31 pages, 4 figures", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20294.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20294", "categories": ["Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "DALI框架通过自监督编码器从交互中推断潜在上下文表示，实现零样本泛化，在cMDP基准测试中超越基线。", "motivation": "解决强化学习中适应未见环境条件的问题，避免显式上下文变量的限制。", "method": "集成Dreamer架构，使用自监督编码器预测前向动态，生成可操作表示来调节世界模型和策略。", "result": "在cMDP基准测试中显著优于无上下文基线，常超越有上下文基线，支持零样本泛化。", "conclusion": "DALI通过潜在空间实现反事实一致性和高效上下文推断，提升泛化能力。"}}

Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent, an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process, effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root cause localization in complex microservice environments.", "subjects": "Software Engineering (cs.SE); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20370.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20370", "categories": ["Software Engineering (cs.SE)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文针对微服务系统故障定位问题，提出RCLAgent方法，基于多智能体递归思维框架，集成多源数据和工具辅助分析，在公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，仅需单次请求即可精确定位根因。", "motivation": "解决微服务系统因复杂性和频繁故障导致的可靠性问题，现有方法依赖预定义模式或缺乏可解释性，无法适应动态环境。", "method": "采用多智能体递归思维框架，结合递归思维策略指导LLM推理，整合多智能体数据和工具分析。", "result": "实验显示RCLAgent在多个公开数据集上优于state-of-the-art方法，仅用单次请求即可精确定位根因。", "conclusion": "RCLAgent有效提升微服务系统根因定位的效率和精度，适用于复杂环境。"}}

This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer architecture: \\textbf{\\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \\textbf{\\textit{Prompt Orchestration Layer}}, and \\textbf{\\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer: directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics, and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of collaborative strategies (\\emph{Retain}, \\emph{Translate}, \\emph{Integrate}, and \\emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring. Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing.
