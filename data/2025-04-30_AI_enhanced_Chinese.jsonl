However, most existing RAG approaches are limited to a text-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other modalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single modality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the type of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot address. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with diverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the observation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space derived from a single combined corpus causes a modality gap, where the retrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose a modality-aware routing mechanism that dynamically identifies the most appropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it. Also, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity levels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of the query. We validate UniversalRAG on 8 benchmarks spanning multiple modalities, showing its superiority over modality-specific and unified baselines.", "subjects": "Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Information Retrieval (cs.IR); Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "comments": "", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20734.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20734", "categories": ["Computation and Language (cs.CL)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)", "Information Retrieval (cs.IR)", "Machine Learning (cs.LG)"], "matching_keywords": ["@RAG"], "AI": {"tldr": "UniversalRAG是一个新颖的检索增强生成框架，旨在从具有多样模态和粒度的异构源中检索和整合知识，以解决现实世界查询中知识类型广泛变化的问题。", "motivation": "现有的RAG方法大多局限于文本语料库，而现实世界的查询需要多种类型的知识源。", "method": "提出了一种模态感知路由机制，动态识别最合适的模态特定语料库并在其中进行针对性检索，同时将每种模态组织成多个粒度级别。", "result": "在跨越多个模态的8个基准测试中验证了UniversalRAG的优越性。", "conclusion": "UniversalRAG通过从异构源中检索和整合知识，有效地解决了单一知识源无法满足多样化查询需求的问题。"}}

Inspired by interpretability literature exploring the internals of models, we propose a novel class of model-internal confidence estimators (MICE) to better assess confidence when calling tools. MICE first decodes from each intermediate layer of the language model using logitLens and then computes similarity scores between each layer's generation and the final output.

This principle of cognitive mapping is universal to agents with limited resources. Living organisms, people, and algorithms all face the problem of forming functional representations of their world under various computing constraints. In this work, we explore the hypothesis that human resource-efficient planning may arise from representing the world as predictably structured. Building on the metaphor of concepts as programs, we propose that cognitive maps can take the form of generative programs that exploit predictability and redundancy, in contrast to directly encoding spatial layouts. We use a behavioral experiment to show that people who navigate in structured spaces rely on modular planning strategies that align with programmatic map representations. We describe a computational model that predicts human behavior in a variety of structured scenarios. This model infers a small distribution over possible programmatic cognitive maps conditioned on human prior knowledge of the world, and uses this distribution to generate resource-efficient plans. Our models leverages a Large Language Model as an embedding of human priors, implicitly learned through training on a vast corpus of human data.

To address these limitations, we propose TreeHop, an embedding-level framework without the need for LLMs in query refinement. TreeHop dynamically updates query embeddings by fusing semantic information from prior queries and retrieved documents, enabling iterative retrieval through embedding-space operations alone. This method replaces the traditional \"Retrieve-Rewrite-Vectorize-Retrieve\" cycle with a streamlined \"Retrieve-Embed-Retrieve\" loop, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, a rule-based stop criterion is introduced to further prune redundant retrievals, balancing efficiency and recall rate.

Compared to imitation learning, which often struggles to generalize from limited samples, reinforcement learning (RL) can autonomously explore to obtain robust behaviors. Training RL agents through direct interaction with the real world is often impractical and unsafe, while building simulation environments requires extensive manual effort, such as designing scenes and crafting task-specific reward functions. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that constructs simulation environments based on expert demonstrations by identifying scene objects from images and retrieving their corresponding 3D models from existing libraries. We introduce a projection-based reward model for RL policy training that is supervised by a vision-language model (VLM) using human-guided object projection relationships as prompts, with the policy further fine-tuned using expert demonstrations.

This paper presents a novel quantitative approach to shed light on the complex information dynamics arising from the growing use of generative AI tools. Despite their significant impact on the digital ecosystem, these dynamics remain largely uncharted and poorly understood. We propose a stochastic model to characterize the generation, indexing, and dissemination of information in response to new topics. This scenario particularly challenges current LLMs, which often rely on real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to overcome their static knowledge limitations. Our findings suggest that the rapid pace of generative AI adoption, combined with increasing user reliance, can outpace human verification, escalating the risk of inaccurate information proliferation across digital resources.

However, in practice, DR is often inadequately documented due to a lack of motivation and effort from developers. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their capabilities in text comprehension, reasoning, and generation may enable the generation and recovery of DR for architecture decisions. In this study, we evaluated the performance of LLMs in generating DR for architecture decisions. First, we collected 50 Stack Overflow (SO) posts, 25 GitHub issues, and 25 GitHub discussions related to architecture decisions to construct a dataset of 100 architecture-related problems. Then, we selected five LLMs to generate DR for the architecture decisions with three prompting strategies, including zero-shot, chain of thought (CoT), and LLM-based agents. With the DR provided by human experts as ground truth, the Precision of LLM-generated DR with the three prompting strategies ranges from 0.267 to 0.278, Recall from 0.627 to 0.715, and F1-score from 0.351 to 0.389.

Distinguishing between heuristic-based human adaptation and rule-based AI search, we model interactions across modular (parallel) and sequenced (interdependent) tasks using an NK model. Our results reveal that in modular tasks, AI often substitutes for humans - delivering higher payoffs unless human expertise is very high, and the AI search space is either narrowly focused or extremely broad. In sequenced tasks, interesting complementarities emerge. When an expert human initiates the search and AI subsequently refines it, aggregate performance is maximized. Conversely, when AI leads, excessive heuristic refinement by the human can reduce payoffs. We also show that even \"hallucinatory\" AI - lacking memory or structure - can improve outcomes when augmenting low-capability humans by helping escape local optima. These results yield a robust implication: the effectiveness of AI-human collaboration depends less on context or industry, and more on the underlying task structure.

While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied.
