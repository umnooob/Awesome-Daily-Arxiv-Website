However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance.

Departing from classical Stackelberg assumptions of complete information and rational agents, our formulation allows each agent to reason through structured prompts, generate probabilistic behaviors via LLMs, and adapt their strategies through internal cognition and belief updates. We define two equilibrium concepts: reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal prompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning equilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized models over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded rationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation.

We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from reactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based reinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as isolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of synthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions based on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than responding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model environment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated action sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term dynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation capabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless coordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving scenarios.

One can identify themes and concepts from a text, on a low level (without knowledge of the specific language) by using process coherence as a guide. Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent `intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and assessing the work done to form them. Scale separation can be used to sort parts into `intended' content and `ambient context', using the spacetime coherence as a measure. This offers an elementary but pragmatic interpretation of latent intentionality for very low computational cost, and without reference to extensive training or reasoning capabilities.

Due to the quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length, these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain. First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g., pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs. plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g., ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often underperform when directly applied to compact designs.

The HAPPO algorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update scheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS). However, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing (ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our experiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update scheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to achieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and ParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG) algorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$ with the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\\phi_{\\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived from Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating the conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential policy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC) as the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to optimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for OMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously achieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function computation.

However, existing automatic dietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as recipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter nutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including allergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In Switzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains fragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant nutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we introduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our best knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with nutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national nutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment pipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first benchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge augmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the graph with relevant nutritional information.

This principle forms the basis of transfer learning, where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where, due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed scenes.

Though RAG systems are widely applied in various applications, recent studies have also revealed its vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where malicious information injected into external knowledge sources can mislead the system into producing incorrect or harmful responses. However, these studies focus exclusively on RAG systems using unstructured textual data sources, leaving the security risks of KG-RAG largely unexplored, despite the fact that KGs present unique vulnerabilities due to their structured and editable nature. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of the security issue of KG-RAG methods through data poisoning attacks. To this end, we introduce a practical, stealthy attack setting that aligns with real-world implementation. We propose an attack strategy that first identifies adversarial target answers and then inserts perturbation triples to complete misleading inference chains in the KG, increasing the likelihood that KG-RAG methods retrieve and rely on these perturbations during generation.

While multi-agent frameworks can improve solution quality by leveraging multiple LLMs, existing methods are often computationally expensive, both at training and inference time. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges by training only a single leader LLM to coordinate a team of untrained peer agents. To this end, we propose Multi-agent guided Leader Policy \\textbf{O}ptimization (MLPO), a novel approach which trains the leader to evaluate and synthesize agent responses without auxiliary value networks or explicit agent feedback.

This contrasts with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios.

{"id": "2507.09992", "title": "Evolution of Fear and Social Rewards in Prey-Predator Relationship", "authors": ["Yuji Kanagawa", "Kenji Doya"], "abstract": "Fear is a critical brain function for detecting danger and learning to avoid specific stimuli that can lead to danger. While fear is believed to have evolved under pressure from predators, experimentally reproducing the evolution is challenging. To investigate the relationship between environmental conditions, the evolution of fear, and the evolution of other rewards, such as food reward and social reward, we developed a distributed evolutionary simulation. In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate reward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators, and learn behaviors via reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, our simulation revealed that social reward for observing the same species is more important for prey to survive, and fear-like negative reward for observing predators evolves only after acquiring social reward. We also found that the predator with increased hunting ability (larger mouth) amplified fear emergence, but also that fear evolution is more stable with non-evolving predators that are bad at chasing prey. Additionally, unlike for predators, we found that positive rewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats, as areas with abundant leftover food develop around them. These findings suggest that fear and social reward have had a complex interplay with each other through evolution, along with the nature of predators and threats.", "subjects": "Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)", "comments": "Preprint.

This paper evaluates AI-driven NPCs within a VR interrogation simulator, focusing on their perceived realism, usability, and system performance. The simulator features two AI-powered NPCs, a suspect, and a partner, using GPT-4 Turbo to engage participants in a scenario to determine the suspect's guilt or innocence. A user study with 18 participants assessed the system using the System Usability Scale (SUS), Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), and a Virtual Agent Believability Questionnaire, alongside latency measurements for speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, and overall (cycle) latency. Results showed an average cycle latency of 7 seconds, influenced by the increasing conversational context. Believability scored 6.67 out of 10, with high ratings in behavior, social relationships, and intelligence but moderate scores in emotion and personality. The system achieved a SUS score of 79.44, indicating good usability.
