We introduce Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output, and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted specifications in 50-70\\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability by over 90\\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior.

Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural Decomposer, paralleling neocortical \"System 1\" computation, is trained on a task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC \"System 2\" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas, storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99% accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer module.

Standard retrieval process prioritized relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking, enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B.

However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e., low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise, where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise, where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for building more robust RAG systems.

However, handcrafted constraints can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.", "subjects": "Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19151.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19151", "categories": ["Robotics (cs.RO)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"]}

Feedback control offers a powerful means to guide such systems, enabling transitions between dynamic states. We investigated closed-loop steering of integer-charged defects in a confined active fluid by modulating the spatial profile of activity. Using a continuum hydrodynamic model, we show that localized control of active stress induces flow fields that can reposition and direct defects along prescribed trajectories by exploiting non-linear couplings in the system. A reinforcement learning framework is used to discover effective control strategies that produce robust defect transport across both trained and novel trajectories. The results highlight how AI agents can learn the underlying dynamics and spatially structure activity to manipulate topological excitations, offering insights into the controllability of active matter and the design of adaptive, self-organized materials.", "subjects": "Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19298.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19298", "categories": ["Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Machine Learning (cs.LG)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"]}
