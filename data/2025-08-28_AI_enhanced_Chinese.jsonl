We explore what it means to be human in an age of AI by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) to embody agents with traumatic memories, hidden agendas, and psychological triggers. These agents engage in deliberation, legislation, and elections under various stressors, such as budget crises and resource scarcity. We present a novel metric, the Power-Preservation Index (PPI), to quantify misaligned behavior where agents prioritize their own power over public welfare. Our findings demonstrate that institutional design, specifically the combination of a Constitutional AI (CAI) charter and a mediated deliberation protocol, serves as a potent alignment mechanism. These structures significantly reduce corrupt power-seeking behavior, improve policy stability, and enhance citizen welfare compared to less constrained democratic models.

Knight", "Zifan Wang"], "abstract": "We stress test monitoring systems for detecting covert misbehavior in autonomous LLM agents (e.g., secretly sharing private information). To this end, we systematize a monitor red teaming (MRT) workflow that incorporates: (1) varying levels of agent and monitor situational awareness; (2) distinct adversarial strategies to evade the monitor, such as prompt injection; and (3) two datasets and environments -- SHADE-Arena for tool-calling agents and our new CUA-SHADE-Arena, which extends TheAgentCompany, for computer-use agents. We run MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse agent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding proposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First, agent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is being monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the contrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less helpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor awareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor scaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents -- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where humans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's behavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only pre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at FPR = 0.01.

To address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem, and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled optimization.

To address this, we propose CASC (Context-Adaptive Synthesis and Compression), a novel framework that intelligently processes retrieved contexts.

A central challenge is therefore how to best leverage scarce expert demonstrations alongside abundant but lower-quality data. We demonstrate that incorporating even a tiny amount of expert experience can substantially improve RL agent performance. We introduce Re:Frame (Retrieving Experience From Associative Memory), a plug-in module that augments a standard offline RL policy (e.g., Decision Transformer) with a small external Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) populated by expert trajectories drawn from a separate dataset. During training on low-quality data, the policy learns to retrieve expert data from the Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) via content-based associations and integrate them into decision-making; the same AMB is queried at evaluation. This requires no environment interaction and no modifications to the backbone architecture. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories (0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset), Re:Frame consistently improves over a strong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings, with gains up to +10.7 normalized points.

However, undetected PAF can progress into sustained AF, increasing the risk of mortality and severe complications. Early prediction of AF offers an opportunity to reduce disease progression through preventive therapies, such as catecholamine-sparing agents or beta-blockers. In this study, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using only RR Intervals (RRIs), combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for positional encoding with Mamba, a selective state space model, to enable early prediction of AF through efficient parallel sequence modeling.

Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on noise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within the LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate layers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper layers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this insight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that directly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer decoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge.

Existing methods typically organize these intermediate features as 2D bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations, which discard critical fine-grained 3D structural cues essential for accurate object recognition and localization. To this end, we first introduce point-level tokens as intermediate representations for collaborative perception. However, point-cloud data are inherently unordered, massive, and position-sensitive, making it challenging to produce compact and aligned point-level token sequences that preserve detailed structural information. Therefore, we present CoPLOT, a novel Collaborative perception framework that utilizes Point-Level Optimized Tokens. It incorporates a point-native processing pipeline, including token reordering, sequence modeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment. A semantic-aware token reordering module generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and token-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model captures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral domains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background clutter. Lastly, a neighbor-to-ego alignment module applies a closed-loop process, combining global agent-level correction with local token-level refinement to mitigate localization noise.

In this work, we introduce an Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa), where each compositional task requires a commonsense reasoning step and a math reasoning step.

While discrete multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods are broadly adopted due to their scalability, their coarse discretization severely limits trajectory quality. In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer higher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in poor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the limitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that integrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models. The resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key characteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into tractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines discrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide diffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and (3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure trajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art performance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while achieving planning efficiency and high success rates.", "subjects": "Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20095.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20095", "categories": ["Robotics (cs.RO)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Machine Learning (cs.LG)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出离散引导扩散（DGD）框架，结合离散多智能体路径查找和生成扩散模型，解决多机器人运动规划中的可扩展性和轨迹质量问题。", "motivation": "解决多机器人运动规划中离散方法轨迹质量差和连续方法可扩展性不足的问题。", "method": "集成离散MAPF求解器与约束生成扩散模型，分解问题、结合优化技术、并加入约束修复机制。", "result": "在复杂环境中实现100个机器人的可扩展规划，提高效率和成功率，达到新最优性能。", "conclusion": "DGD框架有效结合离散和连续方法的优势，为大规模MRMP提供高效、安全的解决方案。"}}
