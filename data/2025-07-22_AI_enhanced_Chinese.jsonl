The need for human expertise in specific areas may no longer be needed because machines have achieved successful results using artificial intelligence and can make the right decisions in critical situations. This process is possible with the help of deep learning (DL), one of the most popular artificial intelligence technologies. One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the development of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In this work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene understanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to investigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of several Backbones as encoders for models. The obtained results show that choosing the appropriate backbone has a great effect on the performance of the model for semantic segmentation. Better performance in semantic segmentation allows us to understand better the scene and the environment around the agent.

Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature Encoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct reference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in the encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced and irrelevant information interference is suppressed. In addition, we propose a Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (PRAG) that employs a hierarchical feature fusion mechanism to integrate reference prior information with input features from global to local.

Yet, human-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make unexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or immediate reward. This trait, often dubbed \"free will\" in a loose sense, might be crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in problem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free Will Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI agents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their decision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive state as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses probabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a quantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms analogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to improve an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen changes.

Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model.

CAIS quantifies an action's influence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned distribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the baseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward that isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise. We test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where correlation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is subjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to filter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy. Furthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our agent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the \"extinction burst\" phenomenon.

Recently, MARL has emerged as a promising solution for this problem, leveraging decentralized learning to address the curse of dimensionality caused by the large number of agents in the ride-hailing market and the resulting expansive state and action spaces. However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing approaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values, which becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.

First, we adapt GRPO to ride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to eliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired by GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO framework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet, the optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we term One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO).

Their execution requires the Gas mechanism to ensure efficiency and fairness. However, due to non-optimal coding practices, many contracts contain Gas waste patterns that need to be optimized. Existing solutions mostly rely on manual discovery, which is inefficient, costly to maintain, and difficult to scale. Recent research uses large language models (LLMs) to explore new Gas waste patterns. However, it struggles to remain compatible with existing patterns, often produces redundant patterns, and requires manual validation/rewriting. To address this gap, we present GasAgent, the first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines compatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new patterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four specialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate in a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements. Experiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent successfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas savings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with existing tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation studies. To assess broader usability, we further evaluate 500 contracts generated by five representative LLMs across 10 categories and find that GasAgent optimizes 79.8% of them, with deployment Gas savings ranging from 4.79% to 13.93%, showing its usability as the optimization layer for LLM-assisted smart contract development.", "subjects": "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15761.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15761", "categories": ["Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "GasAgent是一个多代理框架，用于智能合约中的Gas优化，结合现有模式的兼容性和新模式的自动发现/验证，实现端到端优化。", "motivation": "解决智能合约中由于非最优编码实践导致的Gas浪费问题，现有解决方案效率低、维护成本高且难以扩展。", "method": "GasAgent由四个专门代理（Seeker、Innovator、Executor和Manager）组成，通过闭环协作识别、验证和应用Gas节省改进。", "result": "在100个已验证的真实世界合约上，GasAgent成功优化了82个合约，平均部署Gas节省9.97%。在500个由五个代表性LLM生成的合约上，优化了79.8%，Gas节省范围从4.79%到13.93%。", "conclusion": "GasAgent作为LLM辅助智能合约开发的优化层，展示了其广泛的可用性和有效性。"}}

However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that providing individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated activity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee other team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or physician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework for effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent system that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from individualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an overseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The PCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision. This effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen asynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we compared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across 60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality intake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the overseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions. PCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP consultations in prior work.

The current paradigms for timely data processing are edge computing and data stream processing (DSP). Edge computing places resources closer to where data is generated, while stream processing analyzes the unbounded high-speed data in motion. However, edge stream processing faces rapid workload fluctuations, complicating resource provisioning. Inadequate resource allocation leads to bottlenecks, whereas excess allocation results in wastage. Existing reactive methods, such as threshold-based policies and queuing theory scale only after performance degrades, potentially violating SLAs. Although reinforcement learning (RL) offers a proactive approach through agents that learn optimal runtime adaptation policies, it requires extensive simulation. Furthermore, predictive machine learning models face online distribution and concept drift that minimize their accuracy. We propose a three-step solution to the proactive edge stream processing autoscaling problem. Firstly, a GRU neural network forecasts the upstream load using real-world and synthetic DSP datasets. Secondly, a transfer learning framework integrates the predictive model into an online stream processing system using the DTW algorithm and joint distribution adaptation to handle the disparities between offline and online domains. Finally, a horizontal autoscaling module dynamically adjusts the degree of operator parallelism, based on predicted load while considering edge resource constraints.

Additionally, developing generalist agents that can adapt efficiently in real-world environments often requires leveraging these reward-free signals to guide learning and behavior. However, while intrinsic motivation techniques provide a means for agents to seek out novel or uncertain states in the absence of explicit rewards, they are often challenged by dense reward environments or the complexity of high-dimensional state and action spaces. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely directly on the unprocessed intrinsic reward signals, which can make it difficult to shape or control the agent's exploration effectively. We propose a framework that can effectively utilize expert demonstrations, even when they are incomplete and imperfect. By applying a mapping function to transform the similarity between an agent's state and expert data into a shaped intrinsic reward, our method allows for flexible and targeted exploration of expert-like behaviors. We employ a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts to capture a diverse range of behaviors and accommodate missing information in demonstrations.

To this end, we introduce the Constitutional Controller (CoCo), a novel framework designed to enhance the safety and reliability of agents by reasoning over deep probabilistic logic programs representing constraints such as those found in shared traffic spaces. Furthermore, we propose the concept of self-doubt, implemented as a probability density conditioned on doubt features such as travel velocity, employed sensors, or health factors. In a real-world aerial mobility study, we demonstrate CoCo's advantages for intelligent autonomous systems to learn appropriate doubts and navigate complex and uncertain environments safely and compliantly.", "subjects": "Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15478.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15478", "categories": ["Robotics (cs.RO)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Machine Learning (cs.LG)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文介绍了一种名为宪法控制器（CoCo）的新框架，旨在通过结合神经符号系统和自我怀疑概念，提高自主代理在不确定环境中的安全性和可靠性。", "motivation": "解决在不确定环境中确保自主代理可靠和规则遵从行为的根本挑战。", "method": "结合概率符号白盒推理模型与深度学习方法，引入宪法控制器框架和自我怀疑概念。", "result": "在真实世界的空中移动研究中，展示了CoCo在学习和导航复杂不确定环境中的优势。", "conclusion": "神经符号系统和自我怀疑概念的结合为自主代理在复杂环境中的安全合规导航提供了强大解决方案。"}}

The method alternates between solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation. Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference benchmarks with relative $L^2$-errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and ten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise, the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding smoother value functions and lower residuals.
