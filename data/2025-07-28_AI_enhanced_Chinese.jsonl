Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural Decomposer, paralleling neocortical \"System 1\" computation, is trained on a task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC \"System 2\" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas, storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99% accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer module.

Standard retrieval process prioritized relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking, enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in enhancing answer generation performance.

A powerful method to mitigate this issue involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.

However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e., low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise, where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise, where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for building more robust RAG systems.
