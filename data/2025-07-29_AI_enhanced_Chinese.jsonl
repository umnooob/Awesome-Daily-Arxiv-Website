To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints, subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and agent-agent misalignment.

Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\\times 5$ to $15\\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms.

Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value systems.

To address these limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization framework.

Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step, self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \\emph{learned} to mean-squared error $\\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\\varepsilon$-sub-optimal, the probability of violating \\emph{any} safety property is bounded while still ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF, which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict.

This paradigm shift -- from scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how to evolve.

In realistic reasoning scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving processes.

To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach.

Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation compared to the state-of-the-art method.", "subjects": "Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": "14 pages, 5 figures", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20850.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20850", "categories": ["Robotics (cs.RO)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种新颖的框架，用于模拟自动驾驶车辆（AV）与行人之间的交互，该框架结合了自由能原则启发的认知过程建模方法，以提高交互的真实性。通过认知风险社会力模型和图形卷积网络，AV能够在行人密集的环境中做出更合理和知情的决策。", "motivation": "解决自动驾驶车辆在与易受伤害的道路使用者（如行人）交互时，实现类似人类的预测和决策制定的关键挑战。现有研究主要针对小型移动机器人的群导航，无法直接应用于AV，且行人行为模式固定，无法动态响应AV动作。", "method": "提出了一种结合自由能原则启发的认知过程建模方法，用于AV和行人模型。行人模型使用认知风险社会力模型调整目标导向和排斥力，AV则利用融合的风险构建动态风险感知邻接矩阵，用于Soft Actor-Critic架构中的图形卷积网络。", "result": "仿真结果表明，与最先进的方法相比，提出的框架有效提高了AV导航的安全性、效率和平滑性。", "conclusion": "该框架通过模拟更真实的交互动态，为自动驾驶车辆在行人密集环境中的导航提供了更安全、高效的解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值。"}}
