To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings.

In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average.

Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for computer-use agents.

A critical, yet understudied, issue is the potential divergence between an LLM's stated preferences (its reported alignment with general principles) and its revealed preferences (inferred from decisions in contextualized scenarios). Such deviations raise fundamental concerns for the interpretability, trustworthiness, reasoning transparency, and ethical deployment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications. This work formally defines and proposes a method to measure this preference deviation. We investigate how LLMs may activate different guiding principles in specific contexts, leading to choices that diverge from previously stated general principles. Our approach involves crafting a rich dataset of well-designed prompts as a series of forced binary choices and presenting them to LLMs. We compare LLM responses to general principle prompts stated preference with LLM responses to contextualized prompts revealed preference, using metrics like KL divergence to quantify the deviation. We repeat the analysis across different categories of preferences and on four mainstream LLMs and find that a minor change in prompt format can often pivot the preferred choice regardless of the preference categories and LLMs in the test.

Early video understanding methods based on large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically adopt a single-pass reasoning paradigm without dynamic feedback, limiting the model's capacity to self-correct and adapt in complex scenarios. Recent efforts have attempted to address this limitation by incorporating reward models and reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning, or by employing tool-agent frameworks. However, these approaches face several challenges, including high annotation costs, reward signals that fail to capture real-time reasoning states, and low inference efficiency. To overcome these issues, we propose ReAgent-V, a novel agentic video understanding framework that integrates efficient frame selection with real-time reward generation during inference. These reward signals not only guide iterative answer refinement through a multi-perspective reflection mechanism-adjusting predictions from conservative, neutral, and aggressive viewpoints-but also enable automatic filtering of high-quality data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO). ReAgent-V is lightweight, modular, and extensible, supporting flexible tool integration tailored to diverse tasks.

So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the \"eyes\" of human perception while neglecting the \"ears\", namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots with \"eyes and ears\" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset, Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model, trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and respond appropriately.

As agents engage with one another, they must coordinate to accomplish both individual and collective goals. However, this complex social organization may unintentionally misalign some or all of these agents with human values or user preferences. Drawing on social sciences, we analyze how social structure can deter or shatter group and individual values.

Recent advances suggest that large language models, with their rich world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, could complement RL by enabling semantic state modeling and task-agnostic planning. In this work, we propose the Agentic Episodic Control (AEC), a novel architecture that integrates RL with LLMs to enhance decision-making. The AEC can leverage a large language model (LLM) to map the observations into language-grounded embeddings, which further can be stored in an episodic memory for rapid retrieval of high-value experiences. Simultaneously, a World-Graph working memory module is utilized to capture structured environmental dynamics in order to enhance relational reasoning. Furthermore, a lightweight critical state detector dynamically arbitrates between the episodic memory recall and the world-model-guided exploration. On the whole, by combining the trial-and-error learning scheme with LLM-derived semantic priors, the proposed AEC can improve both data efficiency and generalizability in reinforcement learning. In experiments on BabyAI-Text benchmark tasks, AEC demonstrates substantial improvements over existing baselines, especially on complex and generalization tasks like FindObj, where it outperforms the best baseline by up to 76%.

Existing benchmarks inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs, long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy.

For instance, proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains; the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting in unpredictable derived risks.

We propose a new preference model that incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error on the final learned policy based on the \\textit{mismatch} between the human's beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs.

This includes the ability to weigh moral trade-offs between self-interest and the well-being of subordinate agents. The Shepherd Test thus challenges traditional AI evaluation paradigms by emphasizing moral agency, hierarchical behavior, and complex decision-making under existential stakes.

While existing approaches like topological maps offer efficient spatial priors, they fail to model transient object relationships, whereas dense neural representations (e.g., NeRF) incur prohibitive computational costs. Inspired by the hierarchical scene representation and video scene graph generation works, we propose Hi-Dyna Graph, a hierarchical dynamic scene graph architecture that integrates persistent global layouts with localized dynamic semantics for embodied robotic autonomy. Our framework constructs a global topological graph from posed RGB-D inputs, encoding room-scale connectivity and large static objects (e.g., furniture), while environmental and egocentric cameras populate dynamic subgraphs with object position relations and human-object interaction patterns. A hybrid architecture is conducted by anchoring these subgraphs to the global topology using semantic and spatial constraints, enabling seamless updates as the environment evolves. An agent powered by large language models (LLMs) is employed to interpret the unified graph, infer latent task triggers, and generate executable instructions grounded in robotic affordances. We conduct complex experiments to demonstrate Hi-Dyna Grap's superior scene representation effectiveness.

Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in sparse reward and reward-free environments, including class of methods known as intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and thus fail to produce robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in unconstrained, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed to capture robust autonomous exploration observed in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) motivates naturalistic behavior by tracking divergence between the agent's current world model and an ethological prior. We demonstrate that artificial embodied agents trained with 3M-Progress capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously-behaving larval zebrafish, introducing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation.

Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) struggles in these environments, as scattered and evolving feedback makes optimal decision-making challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a solution by structuring unorganized network feedback into meaningful latent representations, helping RL agents recognize patterns more effectively. For example, in O-RAN slicing, concepts like SNR, power levels and throughput are semantically related, and LLMs can naturally cluster them, providing a more interpretable state representation. To leverage this capability, we introduce a contextualization-based adaptation method that integrates learnable prompts into an LLM-augmented DRL framework. Instead of relying on full model fine-tuning, we refine state representations through task-specific prompts that dynamically adjust to network conditions. Utilizing ORANSight, an LLM trained on O-RAN knowledge, we develop Prompt-Augmented Multi agent RL (PA-MRL) framework. Learnable prompts optimize both semantic clustering and RL objectives, allowing RL agents to achieve higher rewards in fewer iterations and adapt more efficiently.

However, recent RPAs are often built on explicit dialogue data, lacking deep, human-like internal thought processes, resulting in superficial knowledge and style expression. While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct application is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role) and style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than character-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two important stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style Optimization (RSO). RIA explicitly guides the model with character profiles during reasoning to counteract attention diversion, and then RSO aligns reasoning style with the character and scene via LRM distillation to mitigate style drift.

TraCR-TMF identifies threats, potential attack techniques, and corresponding countermeasures by leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK matrix through three LLM-based approaches: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method requiring no expert input, (ii) an in-context learning approach requiring low expert input, and (iii) a supervised fine-tuning method requiring moderate expert input. TraCR-TMF also maps attack paths to critical assets by analyzing vulnerabilities using a customized LLM. The framework was evaluated in two scenarios. First, it identified relevant attack techniques across transportation CPS applications, with 90% precision as validated by experts. Second, using a fine-tuned LLM, it successfully predicted multiple exploitations including lateral movement, data exfiltration, and ransomware-related encryption that occurred during a major real-world cyberattack incident. These results demonstrate TraCR-TMF's effectiveness in CPS threat modeling, its reduced reliance on cybersecurity expertise, and its adaptability across CPS domains.", "subjects": "Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00831.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00831", "categories": ["Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["@RAG"]}

However, existing systems struggle to maintain speaker consistency, model overlapping speech, and synthesize coherent conversations efficiently. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix2, a fully non-autoregressive framework for zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation. CoVoMix2 directly predicts mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using a flow-matching-based generative model, eliminating the reliance on intermediate token representations. To better capture realistic conversational dynamics, we propose transcription-level speaker disentanglement, sentence-level alignment, and prompt-level random masking strategies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines like MoonCast and Sesame in speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed. Notably, CoVoMix2 operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt and supports controllable dialogue generation, including overlapping speech and precise timing control, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world speech generation scenarios.", "subjects": "Sound (cs.SD); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00885.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00885", "categories": ["Sound (cs.SD)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"]}

This paper examines how prompt injection can cause tool-calling agents to leak personal data observed during task execution. Using a fictitious banking agent, we develop data flow-based attacks and integrate them into AgentDojo, a recent benchmark for agentic security. To enhance its scope, we also create a richer synthetic dataset of human-AI banking conversations. In 16 user tasks from AgentDojo, LLMs show a 15-50 percentage point drop in utility under attack, with average attack success rates (ASR) around 20 percent; some defenses reduce ASR to zero. Most LLMs, even when successfully tricked by the attack, avoid leaking highly sensitive data like passwords, likely due to safety alignments, but they remain vulnerable to disclosing other personal data. The likelihood of password leakage increases when a password is requested along with one or two additional personal details. In an extended evaluation across 48 tasks, the average ASR is around 15 percent, with no built-in AgentDojo defense fully preventing leakage. Tasks involving data extraction or authorization workflows, which closely resemble the structure of exfiltration attacks, exhibit the highest ASRs, highlighting the interaction between task type, agent performance, and defense efficacy.", "subjects": "Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Computation and Language (cs.CL)", "comments": "25 pages, 18 figures, NeurIPS formatting style", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01055.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01055", "categories": ["Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)", "Computation and Language (cs.CL)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent", "agentic"]}

RIGOR combines three sources via RAG, the database schema and its documentation, a repository of domain ontologies, and a growing core ontology, to prompt a generative LLM for producing successive, provenance-tagged delta ontology fragments. Each fragment is refined by a judge-LLM before being merged into the core ontology, and the process iterates table-by-table following foreign key constraints until coverage is complete. Applied to real-world databases, our approach outputs ontologies that score highly on standard quality dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, conciseness, adaptability, clarity, and consistency, while substantially reducing manual effort.", "subjects": "Databases (cs.DB); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": "Under review", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01232.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01232", "categories": ["Databases (cs.DB)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["@RAG"]}
{"id": "2506.01463", "title": "Agentic AI and Multiagentic: Are We Reinventing the Wheel?", "authors": ["V.Botti"], "abstract": "The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical origins of \"agentic\" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms, agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.", "subjects": "Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01463.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01463", "categories": ["Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent", "agentic"]}

This paper introduces a novel LLM-Aided MARL (LAMARL) approach, which integrates MARL with LLMs, significantly enhancing sample efficiency without requiring manual design. LAMARL consists of two modules: the first module leverages LLMs to fully automate the generation of prior policy and reward functions. The second module is MARL, which uses the generated functions to guide robot policy training effectively. On a shape assembly benchmark, both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the unique advantages of LAMARL. Ablation studies show that the prior policy improves sample efficiency by an average of 185.9% and enhances task completion, while structured prompts based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and basic APIs improve LLM output success rates by 28.5%-67.5%.

A crucial aspect of this process is the classification of the customer's intent. Presently, most intent classification models for customer care utilise only customer query for intent prediction. This may result in low-accuracy models, which cannot handle ambiguous queries. An ambiguous query like \"I didn't receive my package\" could indicate a delayed order, or an order that was delivered but the customer failed to receive it. Resolution of each of these scenarios requires the execution of very different sequence of steps. Utilizing additional information, such as the customer's order delivery status, in the right manner can help identify the intent for such ambiguous queries. In this paper, we have introduced a context-aware NLU model that incorporates both, the customer query and contextual information from the customer's order status for predicting customer intent. A novel selective attention module is used to extract relevant context features. We have also proposed a multi-task learning paradigm for the effective utilization of different label types available in our training data. Our suggested method, Multi-Task Learning Contextual NLU with Selective Attention Weighted Context (MTL-CNLU-SAWC), yields a 4.8% increase in top 2 accuracy score over the baseline model which only uses user queries, and a 3.5% improvement over existing state-of-the-art models that combine query and context. We have deployed our model to production for Walmart's customer care domain.

We also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on individual agents.
