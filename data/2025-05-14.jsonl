In fact, few labeled data in part of new categories can well alleviate this burden, which coincides with the ease that people can label few of new category data. Therefore, this paper presents a new setting in which a trained agent is able to flexibly switch between the tasks of identifying examples of known (labelled) classes and clustering novel (completely unlabeled) classes as the number of query examples increases by leveraging knowledge learned from only a few (handful) support examples. Drawing inspiration from the discovery of novel categories using prior-based clustering algorithms, we introduce a novel framework that further relaxes its assumptions to the real-world open set level by unifying the concept of model adaptability in few-shot learning. We refer to this setting as Few-Shot Novel Category Discovery (FSNCD) and propose Semi-supervised Hierarchical Clustering (SHC) and Uncertainty-aware K-means Clustering (UKC) to examine the model's reasoning capabilities.

A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools. V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions. We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points.

However, these agents remain fundamentally stateless, treating each decision as isolated, lacking any persistent memory of prior events or outcomes. This reactive behavior constrains optimization, especially in environments where network dynamics exhibit episodic or recurring patterns. In this work, we propose RAN Cortex, a memory-augmented architecture that enables contextual recall in AI-based RAN decision systems. RAN Cortex introduces a modular layer composed of four elements: a context encoder that transforms network state into high-dimensional embeddings, a vector-based memory store of past network episodes, a recall engine to retrieve semantically similar situations, and a policy interface that supplies historical context to AI agents in real time or near-real time. We formalize the retrieval-augmented decision problem in the RAN, present a system architecture compatible with O-RAN interfaces, and analyze feasible deployments within the Non-RT and Near-RT RIC domains. Through illustrative use cases such as stadium traffic mitigation and mobility management in drone corridors, we demonstrate how contextual memory improves adaptability, continuity, and overall RAN intelligence.

Marius Zöllner"], "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a ``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization, achieving higher success rates: +9\\% in low traffic density, +21\\% in high traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of RL-based autonomous driving agents.", "subjects": "Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": "Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08264.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08264", "categories": ["Robotics (cs.RO)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"]}
{"id": "2505.08319", "title": "Reciprocity as the Foundational Substrate of Society: How Reciprocal Dynamics Scale into Social Systems", "authors": ["Egil Diau"], "abstract": "A major bottleneck in multi-agent AI is the lack of simulateable models for the bottom-up emergence of social structure under realistic behavioral constraints. Similarly, many foundational theories in economics and sociology including the concepts of \"institutions\" and \"norms\" tend to describe social structures post hoc, often relying on implicit assumptions of shared culture, morality, or symbolic agreement. These concepts are often treated as primitives rather than reconstructed from agent-level behavior, leaving both their origins and operational definitions under-specified. To address this, we propose a three-stage bottom-up framework: Reciprocal Dynamics, capturing individual-level reciprocal exchanges; Norm Stabilization, the consolidation of shared expectations; and Institutional Construction, the externalization of stable patterns into scalable structures. By grounding social emergence in agent-level reciprocity, our framework enables the systematic exploration of how moral, cultural, and institutional structures emerge from cognitively minimal interactions.", "subjects": "Computers and Society (cs.CY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)", "comments": "First draft extending the first position paper.

Multi-Agent Systems with Large Language Models Unmask Fake News", "authors": ["Yuhan Liu", "Yuxuan Liu", "Xiaoqing Zhang", "Xiuying Chen", "Rui Yan"], "abstract": "In today's digital environment, the rapid propagation of fake news via social networks poses significant social challenges. Most existing detection methods either employ traditional classification models, which suffer from low interpretability and limited generalization capabilities, or craft specific prompts for large language models (LLMs) to produce explanations and results directly, failing to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities fully. Inspired by the saying that \"truth becomes clearer through debate,\" our study introduces a novel multi-agent system with LLMs named TruEDebate (TED) to enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of fake news detection. TED employs a rigorous debate process inspired by formal debate settings. Central to our approach are two innovative components: the DebateFlow Agents and the InsightFlow Agents. The DebateFlow Agents organize agents into two teams, where one supports and the other challenges the truth of the news. These agents engage in opening statements, cross-examination, rebuttal, and closing statements, simulating a rigorous debate process akin to human discourse analysis, allowing for a thorough evaluation of news content. Concurrently, the InsightFlow Agents consist of two specialized sub-agents: the Synthesis Agent and the Analysis Agent. The Synthesis Agent summarizes the debates and provides an overarching viewpoint, ensuring a coherent and comprehensive evaluation. The Analysis Agent, which includes a role-aware encoder and a debate graph, integrates role embeddings and models the interactions between debate roles and arguments using an attention mechanism, providing the final judgment.", "subjects": "Social and Information Networks (cs.SI); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": "SIGIR 2025", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08532.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08532", "categories": ["Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"]}

Lehmann"], "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the de facto industry standard for user-facing NLP applications, offering the ability to integrate data without re-training or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). This capability enhances the quality and accuracy of responses but also introduces novel security and privacy challenges, particularly when sensitive data is integrated. With the rapid adoption of RAG, securing data and services has become a critical priority. This paper first reviews the vulnerabilities of RAG pipelines, and outlines the attack surface from data pre-processing and data storage management to integration with LLMs. The identified risks are then paired with corresponding mitigations in a structured overview. In a second step, the paper develops a framework that combines RAG-specific security considerations, with existing general security guidelines, industry standards, and best practices. The proposed framework aims to guide the implementation of robust, compliant, secure, and trustworthy RAG systems.", "subjects": "Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Information Retrieval (cs.IR)", "comments": "8 pages, 3 figures, Sara Ott and Lukas Ammann contributed equally", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08728.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08728", "categories": ["Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Information Retrieval (cs.IR)"], "matching_keywords": ["@RAG"]}
