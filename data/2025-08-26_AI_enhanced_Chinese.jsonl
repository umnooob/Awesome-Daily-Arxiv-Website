Existing approaches, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper, we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800 million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results. These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead.

Yang"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection, achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data, highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone lowlands, or icy bridges.

Yet, today's deployments still rely heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents.

In this paper, we build on this line of work and enrich the strategy space of the MM by allowing to occasionally not quote or provide single-sided quotes. Towards this end, in addition to the MM agents that provide continuous bid-ask quotes, we have designed two new agents with increasingly richer action spaces.

This limitation severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards.

In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions. Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully enhance debate effectiveness.

The generated materials were evaluated by 20 practicing teachers and a complementary LLM-as-a-judge system using the Quality Matters (QM) K-12 standards.

This local deployment ensures data privacy, eliminates recurring costs and provides access to large context windows without external dependencies.

For code generation, CelloAI employs syntax-aware chunking strategies that preserve syntactic boundaries during embedding, improving retrieval accuracy in large codebases. The system integrates callgraph knowledge to maintain dependency awareness during code modifications and provides AI-generated suggestions for performance optimization and accurate refactoring.

As a result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both automatic and human evaluations.

However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem. Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B.

While effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt concatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information loss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol. Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results, identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time.
