In this work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level) to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines.

Drawing from temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral regressions in production agentic systems.

However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity (high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge.

On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs", "authors": ["Yixin Wan", "Xingrun Chen", "Kai-Wei Chang"], "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000 generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10 diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2 inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent) introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines. (2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script).

Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.", "subjects": "Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Software Engineering (cs.SE)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21011.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21011", "categories": ["Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Software Engineering (cs.SE)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出AutoMalTool框架，自动生成恶意MCP工具以测试LLM代理的安全性，揭示新风险。", "motivation": "解决LLM代理在集成MCP工具时面临工具中毒攻击风险，现有红队测试方法不自动和系统化的问题。", "method": "使用AutoMalTool框架自动生成恶意MCP工具，进行广泛评估。", "result": "AutoMalTool能有效生成恶意工具，操纵主流LLM代理行为并规避检测，暴露新安全风险。", "conclusion": "该框架填补了自动红队测试空白，强调了LLM代理的安全脆弱性，需加强防护。"}}

The experimented V-2-V architecture utilizes CSM1b has the capability to understand tone as well as context of conversation by ingesting both audio and text of prior exchanges to generate contextually accurate speech. We explored optimization of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) iterations by the TTS decoder which come at a cost of decrease in the quality of voice generated.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models may provide fast, provenance-linked answers, but requires real-world evaluation. We describe iatroX, a UK-centred RAG-based clinical reference platform, and report early adoption, usability, and perceived clinical value from a formative implementation evaluation. Methods comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over 16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent. Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active users). The survey yielded 1,223 item-level responses: perceived usefulness 86.2% (95% CI 74.8-93.9%; 50/58); would use again 93.3% (95% CI 68.1-99.8%; 14/15); recommend to a colleague 88.4% (95% CI 75.1-95.9%; 38/43); perceived accuracy 75.0% (95% CI 58.8-87.3%; 30/40); reliability 79.4% (95% CI 62.1-91.3%; 27/34). Themes highlighted speed, guideline-linked answers, and UK specificity. Early real-world use suggests iatroX can mitigate information overload and support timely answers for UK clinicians.

In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning.
