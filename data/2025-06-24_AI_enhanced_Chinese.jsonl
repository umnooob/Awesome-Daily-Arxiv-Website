How LLMs Value Your Inconvenience", "authors": ["Mateusz Cedro", "Timour Ichmoukhamedov", "Sofie Goethals", "Yifan He", "James Hinns", "David Martens"], "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on behalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their behaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies have assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions. However, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards are at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple LLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and pain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of using current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in responses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to minor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the first person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept unreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10 hours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed (e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for scrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward applications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users' behalf.", "subjects": "Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)", "comments": "12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17367.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17367", "categories": ["Computation and Language (cs.CL)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在个人决策中的行为，特别是在财务奖励与用户舒适度相冲突的情境下。研究发现，当前LLMs在评估用户不适时的表现存在多个问题，质疑其作为决策助手的适用性。", "motivation": "随着LLMs被提议作为近乎自主的AI代理，其在个人决策中的行为尚未被充分理解。本研究旨在探索LLMs在财务奖励与用户舒适度冲突时的决策行为。", "method": "通过量化多个LLMs对一系列用户不适（如额外步行、等待、饥饿和疼痛）所分配的价格，评估其决策行为。", "result": "研究发现：(1)不同LLMs之间的响应存在较大差异；(2)单个LLM对提示措辞的微小变化表现出脆弱性；(3)LLMs可能为重大不适接受极低奖励；(4)LLMs可能在没有不适的情况下拒绝金钱收益。", "conclusion": "这些发现强调了对LLMs如何评估人类不适的审查需求，尤其是在涉及现金与舒适度权衡的应用中。"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching tools within Lightroom.

We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits. JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new avenue for intelligent photo retouching.

While RAG systems aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base - reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs. 38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses. By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency: reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future supply chain tickets.

However, current fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically, inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface. With this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a semantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the semantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ.

While recent work in AI safety and mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment, they often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for other technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render different alignment/control protocols interoperable.

Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked challenges in current benchmarks.

In this paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL control method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both intra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these groups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these groups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group consistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups. Simultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral strategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation. Crucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad applicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in various grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly enhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task specialization, yielding substantial performance improvements.

Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed: per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted injections at key layers still improve language selection.

An intriguing challenge arises when agents interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users: supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose memory and respond readily and timely to queries.

This stems from a fundamental flaw -- semantic similarity does not imply semantic relevance. We introduce SlimRAG, a lightweight framework for retrieval without graphs. SlimRAG replaces structure-heavy components with a simple yet effective entity-aware mechanism. At indexing time, it constructs a compact entity-to-chunk table based on semantic embeddings. At query time, it identifies salient entities, retrieves and scores associated chunks, and assembles a concise, contextually relevant input -- without graph traversal or edge construction. To quantify retrieval efficiency, we propose Relative Index Token Utilization (RITU), a metric measuring the compactness of retrieved content. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that SlimRAG outperforms strong flat and graph-based baselines in accuracy while reducing index size and RITU (e.g., 16.31 vs. 56+), highlighting the value of structure-free, entity-centric context selection.

A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain synchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or inconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper introduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework designed to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in MAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic voting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the relevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational context; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing importance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different time horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based consensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items are agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in the presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N greater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient inter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage and similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations in a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's efficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88% voting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a 92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an 82% cache hit rate for memory access.", "subjects": "Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)", "comments": "13 pages", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17338.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17338", "categories": ["Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文介绍了一种名为'共遗忘协议'的新框架，旨在通过同步内存修剪管理多代理系统中的共享知识，结合语义投票、时间衰减函数和PBFT共识机制，有效减少内存占用并提高决策准确性。", "motivation": "解决多代理系统在复杂动态环境中管理共享知识时，确保分布式内存同步、相关且无过时或无关数据积累的挑战。", "method": "结合上下文感知的语义投票、多尺度时间衰减函数和基于PBFT的共识机制，利用gRPC和Pinecone等技术实现高效通信和存储。", "result": "在模拟环境中，协议实现了内存占用减少52%，遗忘决策准确率88%，PBFT共识成功率92%，内存访问缓存命中率82%。", "conclusion": "共遗忘协议为多代理系统提供了一种高效、可靠的内存管理解决方案，显著提升了系统的性能和可靠性。"}}

While prior work has improved the timeliness and accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions, producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations.

We deployed GeNIE in the Earth Rover Challenge (ERC) at ICRA 2025, where it was evaluated across six countries spanning three continents. GeNIE took first place and achieved 79% of the maximum possible score, outperforming the second-best team by 17%, and completed the entire competition without a single human intervention. These results set a new benchmark for robust, generalizable outdoor robot navigation. We will release the codebase, pretrained model weights, and newly curated datasets to support future research in real-world navigation.", "subjects": "Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": "8 pages, 5 figures.

{"id": "2506.18315", "title": "Use Property-Based Testing to Bridge LLM Code Generation and Validation", "authors": ["Lehan He", "Zeren Chen", "Zhe Zhang", "Jing Shao", "Xiang Gao", "Lu Sheng"], "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but ensuring their outputs to be functionally correct, especially in complex programming tasks, is a persistent challenge. While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers a path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the scarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test generation, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can misdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated Solver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to validate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on specific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define and verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the \"cycle of self-deception\" where tests might share flaws with the code they are meant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative LLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative refinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate semantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting comprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its refinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within this iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a robust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code. Extensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks demonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1 improvements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD methods.", "subjects": "Software Engineering (cs.SE); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18315.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18315", "categories": ["Software Engineering (cs.SE)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文介绍了一种名为Property-Generated Solver的新框架，该框架利用基于属性的测试（PBT）来验证高级程序属性或不变量，而不是依赖于特定的输入输出示例，以提高大型语言模型（LLMs）生成代码的功能正确性。", "motivation": "大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现出色，但确保其输出在复杂编程任务中的功能正确性是一个持续的挑战。传统的测试驱动开发（TDD）在LLMs中的效果常因高质量测试用例的稀缺或自动化测试生成的陷阱（包括有偏见的测试或不准确的输出预测）而受到削弱。", "method": "Property-Generated Solver框架采用两个协作的基于LLM的代理：一个专注于代码生成和迭代改进的生成器，以及一个管理PBT生命周期并从属性违规中制定语义丰富反馈的测试器。", "result": "在多个代码生成基准上的广泛实验结果表明，Property-Generated Solver相对于已建立的TDD方法，实现了显著的pass@1改进，相对增益范围从23.1%到37.3%。", "conclusion": "通过将PBT确立为这一迭代闭环范式中的核心验证引擎，Property-Generated Solver为引导LLMs生成更正确和可泛化的代码提供了一个强大的机制。"}}

Most prior work has relied on scripted or Wizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time, interactive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study addresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a cognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject experiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or practiced independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary (memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by Interactive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the LbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those in the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with lower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural metrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and engaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions: (1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable model for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real classrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing that social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive partners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning outcomes.", "subjects": "Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18365.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18365", "categories": ["Robotics (cs.RO)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本研究通过引入交互式强化学习（Interactive RL）作为可教学社交机器人的认知模型，探索了在真实教室中与自主、类似同伴的社交机器人共同学习的可能性。研究显示，通过教学机器人，儿童在法语词汇记忆和语法规则推理任务上的知识保留率显著提高，尤其是先前知识较低的儿童。", "motivation": "尽管对通过教学学习（LbT）的兴趣日益增长，但很少有研究探讨如何在真实教室中与自主、类似同伴的社交机器人实施这一范式。大多数先前的工作依赖于脚本或Wizard-of-Oz行为，限制了我们对人工代理如何支持实时互动学习的理解。", "method": "本研究通过引入交互式强化学习（Interactive RL）作为可教学社交机器人的认知模型，并在58名小学生中进行了两项实验，比较了教学机器人和独立练习在法语词汇记忆和语法规则推理任务上的效果。", "result": "教学机器人条件下的儿童在知识保留上取得了显著更高的增益，尤其是在语法任务上。先前知识较低的儿童从教学机器人中获益最多。行为指标显示，儿童随着时间的推移调整了他们的教学策略，并在推理任务中更深入地参与。", "conclusion": "这项工作有两个贡献：（1）引入了交互式RL作为一种教学有效且可扩展的同伴机器人学习模型；（2）首次展示了在真实教室中同时部署多个自主机器人的可行性。这些发现扩展了对LbT的理论理解，表明社交机器人不仅可以作为被动的学习者，还可以作为增强元认知参与和长期学习成果的适应性伙伴。"}}

We present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples.
