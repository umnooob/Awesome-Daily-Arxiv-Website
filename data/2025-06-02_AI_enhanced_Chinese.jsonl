Current approaches face two critical shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining of all components when applied to new domains.

This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks.

Existing approaches rely on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to acquire bimanual policies. However, transferring knowledge from single-arm datasets or pre-trained VLA models often fails to generalize effectively, primarily due to the scarcity of bimanual data and the fundamental differences between single-arm and bimanual manipulation. In this paper, we propose a novel bimanual foundation policy by fine-tuning the leading text-to-video models to predict robot trajectories and training a lightweight diffusion policy for action generation. Given the lack of embodied knowledge in text-to-video models, we introduce a two-stage paradigm that fine-tunes independent text-to-flow and flow-to-video models derived from a pre-trained text-to-video model. Specifically, optical flow serves as an intermediate variable, providing a concise representation of subtle movements between images. The text-to-flow model predicts optical flow to concretize the intent of language instructions, and the flow-to-video model leverages this flow for fine-grained video prediction. Our method mitigates the ambiguity of language in single-stage text-to-video prediction and significantly reduces the robot-data requirement by avoiding direct use of low-level actions.

In particular, they should comprehend interleaved multimodal contexts and respond coherently in ongoing exchanges. In this work, we present an initial exploration through the InterMT -- the first preference dataset for multi-turn multimodal interaction, grounded in real human feedback. In this exploration, we particularly emphasize the importance of human oversight, introducing expert annotations to guide the process, motivated by the fact that current MLLMs lack such complex interactive capabilities.

However, dense retrievers often become the bottleneck of RAG systems due to their limited parameters compared to LLMs and their inability to perform step-by-step reasoning. While prompt-based iterative RAG attempts to address these limitations, it is constrained by human-designed workflows. To address these limitations, we propose $\\textbf{R3-RAG}$, which uses $\\textbf{R}$einforcement learning to make the LLM learn how to $\\textbf{R}$eason and $\\textbf{R}$etrieve step by step, thus retrieving comprehensive external knowledge and leading to correct answers. R3-RAG is divided into two stages. We first use cold start to make the model learn the manner of iteratively interleaving reasoning and retrieval. Then we use reinforcement learning to further harness its ability to better explore the external retrieval environment.

This paper introduces a novel parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) based methodology to combine multiple AI and non-AI agents in a causal, rule-based way. Our approach tightly integrates the concept of passage of time, with each agent considered as an entity in the PDES framework and responding to prior requests from other agents. Such coupling mechanism enables the agents to work in a co-operative environment towards a common goal while many tasks run in parallel throughout the simulation. It further enables setting up boundaries to the outputs of the AI agents by applying necessary dynamic constraints using non-AI agents while allowing for scalability through deployment of hundreds of such agents in a larger compute cluster. Distributing smaller AI agents can enable extremely scalable simulations in the future, addressing local memory bottlenecks for model parameter storage. Within a PDES involving both AI and non-AI agents, we break down the problem at hand into structured steps, when necessary, providing a set of multiple choices to the AI agents, and then progressively solve these steps towards a final goal. At each step, the non-AI agents act as unbiased auditors, verifying each action by the AI agents so that certain rules of engagement are followed.

Although many studies focus on improving the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation, very limited work tries to understand the generated code's characteristics and leverage that to improve failed cases. In this paper, as the most straightforward characteristic of code, we investigate the relationship between code complexity and the success of LLM generated code. Using a large set of standard complexity metrics, we first conduct an empirical analysis to explore their correlation with LLM's performance on code generation (i.e., Pass@1). Using logistic regression models, we identify which complexity metrics are most predictive of code correctness. Building on these findings, we propose an iterative feedback method, where LLMs are prompted to generate correct code based on complexity metrics from previous failed outputs. We validate our approach across multiple benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, LeetCode, and BigCodeBench) and various LLMs (i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and GPT-o3 mini), comparing the results with two baseline methods: (a) zero-shot generation, and (b) iterative execution-based feedback without our code complexity insights.

Indeed, prior research has largely overlooked developing agents capable of acquiring planning knowledge from scratch, directly in realistic settings. While realizing this capability is necessary, it presents significant challenges, primarily achieving robustness given the substantial risk of incorporating LLMs' inaccurate knowledge. Moreover, efficiency is crucial for practicality as learning can demand prohibitive exploration.

We present a closed loop, physics aware framework for the automated generation of industrially viable PFDs and PIDs.

To address these challenges, inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Causal-aware LLMs, which integrate the structural causal model (SCM) into the decision-making process to model, update, and utilize structured knowledge of the environment in a ``learning-adapting-acting\" paradigm. Specifically, in the learning stage, we first utilize an LLM to extract the environment-specific causal entities and their causal relations to initialize a structured causal model of the environment.

Finally, in the acting stage, Causal-aware LLMs exploit structured causal knowledge for more efficient policy-making through the reinforcement learning agent. The above processes are performed iteratively to learn causal knowledge, ultimately enabling the causal-aware LLMs to achieve a more accurate understanding of the environment and make more efficient decisions.
