However, this task remains challenging in unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges, we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline, followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a 69% improvement in recall over baseline methods.

In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective, advocating a \"First Reasoning, Then Forecasting\" strategy that explicitly incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction. To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution, a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation.

However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.", "subjects": "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Robotics (cs.RO)", "comments": "", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11662.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11662", "categories": ["Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Computation and Language (cs.CL)", "Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)", "Robotics (cs.RO)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种名为自我基础验证（SGV）的轻量级方法，旨在缓解多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在验证代理轨迹时的同意偏差问题，通过两步过程显著提高了验证的准确性和失败检测率。", "motivation": "在多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）作为验证器评估代理轨迹时，存在一个关键限制：同意偏差，即MLLMs倾向于偏爱其上下文窗口中的信息，常常生成思维链来合理化有缺陷的行为。这种偏差普遍存在于各种模型中，对使用MLLMs作为评估器的多种方法产生影响。", "method": "提出的自我基础验证（SGV）方法通过无条件生成和条件生成两步过程，首先检索关于任务完成的广泛先验知识，然后基于自我生成的先验知识对候选轨迹进行推理和评估。", "result": "增强后的MLLM验证器在准确性和失败检测率上提高了多达20个百分点，并能够实时监督异构代理，在多个基准测试中实现了新的最先进性能。", "conclusion": "SGV方法有效地利用了MLLMs的知识和推理能力，显著提高了其在复杂任务中的验证性能，为AI在无明确成功标准领域的进步提供了新的可能性。"}}

Traditional generative models based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time requirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can effectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature of AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher demands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing environments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC model switching for the first time. IIoT devices acted as multi-agent collaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge servers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task offloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental results show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72% increase in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model numbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is robust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.", "subjects": "Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": "6 pages, 4 figures, accepted by ICCC 2025", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11560.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11560", "categories": ["Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种针对IIoT边缘计算环境的AIGC任务卸载框架，首次考虑了AIGC模型切换引起的延迟和能耗，设计了一种基于多智能体深度确定性策略梯度（MADDPG-MATO）的模型感知AIGC任务卸载算法，以最小化延迟和能耗。实验结果表明，MADDPG-MATO在动态高负载IIoT环境中表现优异。", "motivation": "工业物联网（IIoT）与人工智能生成内容（AIGC）的集成为智能制造提供了新机遇，但也带来了计算密集型任务和低延迟需求的挑战。传统的基于云计算的生成模型难以满足IIoT环境中AIGC任务的实时需求，而边缘计算通过任务卸载可以有效减少延迟。然而，AIGC任务的动态性、模型切换延迟和资源限制对边缘计算环境提出了更高的要求。", "method": "本文提出了一种针对IIoT边缘计算环境的AIGC任务卸载框架，首次考虑了AIGC模型切换引起的延迟和能耗。IIoT设备作为多智能体协同将其动态AIGC任务卸载到部署了不同生成模型的最合适的边缘服务器。设计了一种基于多智能体深度确定性策略梯度（MADDPG-MATO）的模型感知AIGC任务卸载算法，以最小化延迟和能耗。", "result": "实验结果表明，MADDPG-MATO在模型数量从3到6的四组实验中，平均延迟降低了6.98%，能耗降低了7.12%，任务完成率提高了3.72%，证明了所提算法在动态高负载IIoT环境中的鲁棒性和高效性。", "conclusion": "本文提出的MADDPG-MATO算法在IIoT边缘计算环境中有效减少了AIGC任务的延迟和能耗，提高了任务完成率，为智能制造的实时AIGC任务处理提供了有效的解决方案。"}}

Late interaction mechanism over visual language models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based vision augmented Q&A tasks. There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based multi-modal Q&A. Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do not support native multi-vector retrieval.

Neural network pruning methods have successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions for 0/1 Random Variables $\\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware, sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo) and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned considerably with minimal loss in performance.
