To overcome this, we introduce BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure (via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search, enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the structure of the text.

[Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge transfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal representations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the environment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive recovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention instantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect corresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while increasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative reward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent and is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by querying a lookup model with local context information (collisions).

However, their top-down training approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones. A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist. Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical superintelligence.

As artificial agents, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs), become more autonomous, intelligent, and persuasive, they compete with humans for partnerships.

We constructed a communication-based partner selection game and examined the dynamics in hybrid mini-societies of humans and bots powered by a state-of-the-art LLM. Through three experiments (N = 975), we found that bots, though more prosocial than humans and linguistically distinguishable, were not selected preferentially when their identity was hidden. Instead, humans misattributed bots' behaviour to humans and vice versa. Disclosing bots' identity induced a dual effect: it reduced bots' initial chances of being selected but allowed them to gradually outcompete humans by facilitating human learning about the behaviour of each partner type.

Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation. The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex environmental conditions.", "subjects": "Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": "8 papers,7 figures", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13647.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13647", "categories": ["Robotics (cs.RO)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "提出了一种改进的粒子群优化算法PE-PSO，用于解决无人机群在动态环境中的实时轨迹规划问题，通过引入持续探索机制和基于熵的参数调整策略，提高了轨迹质量和计算效率。", "motivation": "解决无人机在动态环境中实时轨迹规划的高计算需求和快速自适应响应问题，传统PSO方法在实时场景中易早熟收敛和延迟。", "method": "提出PE-PSO算法，结合持续探索机制和熵基参数调整策略，使用B样条曲线建模轨迹，并开发多智能体框架结合遗传算法任务分配和分布式PE-PSO。", "result": "模拟结果显示，PE-PSO在轨迹质量、能源效率、障碍物避免和计算时间等方面优于传统PSO和其他基于群体的规划器。", "conclusion": "PE-PSO算法在复杂环境下的实时多无人机操作中表现出高效性和适用性，支持可扩展和协调的轨迹生成。"}}

Relying solely on real-world driving scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created manually.", "subjects": "Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13729.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13729", "categories": ["Robotics (cs.RO)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent", "agentic"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文介绍了一种基于LLM-agent的新框架，用于通过自然语言描述增强现实世界的交通场景，解决了现有方法的局限性。", "motivation": "罕见但关键的场景在测试和评估自动驾驶规划器时构成了重大挑战。仅依赖真实世界驾驶场景需要收集大量数据来捕捉这些场景。虽然自动生成交通场景看起来很有前景，但数据驱动的模型需要大量的训练数据，并且往往缺乏对输出的细粒度控制。此外，从零开始生成新场景可能会引入与原始训练场景的分布偏移，这尤其会削弱基于学习的规划器的评估有效性。", "method": "本文引入了一种基于LLM-agent的新框架，用于通过自然语言描述增强现实世界的交通场景。一个关键的创新是使用了代理设计，使得即使使用较小、成本效益高的LLM也能保持对输出的细粒度控制和高性能。", "result": "广泛的人类专家评估表明，我们的框架能够准确地遵循用户意图，生成与手动创建的场景相媲美的高质量增强场景。", "conclusion": "本文提出的框架能够有效地生成高质量的增强交通场景，为自动驾驶系统的评估提供了可扩展的解决方案。"}}

The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control, etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are reported.
