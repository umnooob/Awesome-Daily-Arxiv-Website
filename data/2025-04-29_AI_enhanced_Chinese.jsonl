A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention of cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient radio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User Equipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach is developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best Effort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS and resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural Network (GNN) and RL.

In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant, but most research is limited to solving small-scale, synthetic problems, neglecting the challenges posed by real-world use cases.

The combination of these two novelties allows the agent to learn effective and generalizable assignment policies for real-world scale DTAPs.

Existing explorations of this threat applied to web agents often focus on a single isolated adversarial goal, test with injected instructions that are either too easy or not truly malicious, and often give the adversary unreasonable access. In order to better focus adversarial research, we construct a new benchmark called WASP (Web Agent Security against Prompt injection attacks) that introduces realistic web agent hijacking objectives and an isolated environment to test them in that does not affect real users or the live web. As part of WASP, we also develop baseline attacks against three popular web agentic systems (VisualWebArena, Claude Computer Use, and Operator) instantiated with various state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation shows that even AI agents backed by models with advanced reasoning capabilities and by models with instruction hierarchy mitigations are susceptible to low-effort human-written prompt injections.

To address these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize high-quality preference data for aligning the target model. Anyprefer frames the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game, where the target model and the judge model collaborate together.

However, due to the variability of coordination goals, the complexity of the decision problem, and the time-consumption of trial-and-error in manual design, finding a well performance reward function to guide RL training to solve complex platoon coordination problems remains challenging. In this paper, we formally define the Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based cooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward function generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which systematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven initialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first initializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements with an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively optimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR module guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a chain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code generation. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward function, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence stability for training.

{"id": "2504.19667", "title": "A Tripartite Perspective on GraphRAG", "authors": ["Michael Banf", "Johannes Kuhn"], "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that demand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability (provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from an initial lexical graph. As a consequence, our Tripartite-GraphRAG approach implements: i) a concept-specific, information-preserving pre-compression of textual chunks; ii) allows for the formation of a concept-specific relevance estimation of embedding similarities grounded in statistics; and iii) avoids common challenges w.r.t. continuous extendability, such as the need for entity resolution and deduplication. By applying a transformation to the knowledge graph, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification problem, drawing on ideas from Markov Random Fields. We evaluate our approach on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses given a set of medical concepts as well as clinical literature. Experiments indicate that it can optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts while reducing their lengths, which may lead to reduced costs and more consistent and reliable LLM outputs.", "subjects": "Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19667.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19667", "categories": ["Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["@RAG"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种结合大型语言模型（LLMs）与三方知识图表示的新方法（Tripartite-GraphRAG），旨在解决LLMs在知识密集型任务中的幻觉、来源可追溯性差和知识更新延迟等问题。通过从初始词汇图出发，对源文档进行概念锚定的预分析，构建连接复杂领域特定对象的知识图，该方法实现了信息保留的预压缩、基于统计的概念特定相关性估计，并避免了连续可扩展性的常见挑战。在医疗保健用例上的实验表明，该方法能优化LLM提示的信息密度、覆盖范围和排列，同时减少提示长度，可能降低成本并提高输出的可靠性和一致性。", "motivation": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在需要事实准确性的领域（如工业自动化和医疗保健）中处理知识密集型任务时存在幻觉、缺乏来源可追溯性和知识更新延迟等问题。本文旨在通过结合LLMs与知识图（GraphRAG）来克服这些缺陷。", "method": "提出了一种结合LLMs与三方知识图表示的新方法（Tripartite-GraphRAG），通过从初始词汇图出发，对源文档进行概念锚定的预分析，构建连接复杂领域特定对象的知识图。该方法实现了信息保留的预压缩、基于统计的概念特定相关性估计，并避免了连续可扩展性的常见挑战。", "result": "在医疗保健用例上的实验表明，Tripartite-GraphRAG方法能优化LLM提示的信息密度、覆盖范围和排列，同时减少提示长度，可能降低成本并提高输出的可靠性和一致性。", "conclusion": "Tripartite-GraphRAG方法为克服LLMs在知识密集型任务中的限制提供了有效的解决方案，通过优化信息处理和提示生成，有望在降低成本的同时提高输出的质量和可靠性。"}}

This paper analyzes tool squatting threats within the context of emerging interoperability standards, such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) or seamless communication between agents protocols. It introduces a comprehensive Tool Registry system designed to mitigate these risks. We propose a security-focused architecture featuring admin-controlled registration, centralized tool discovery, fine grained access policies enforced via dedicated Agent and Tool Registry services, a dynamic trust scoring mechanism based on tool versioning and known vulnerabilities, and just in time credential provisioning.

These agents are not just LLMs; they reason, remember, and act, often with minimal human oversight. This paper introduces a comprehensive threat model tailored specifically for GenAI agents, focusing on how their autonomy, persistent memory access, complex reasoning, and tool integration create novel risks. This research work identifies 9 primary threats and organizes them across five key domains: cognitive architecture vulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution vulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. These threats are not just theoretical they bring practical challenges such as delayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, cross system lateral movement, and subtle goal misalignments that are hard to detect with existing frameworks and standard approaches. To help address this, the research work present two complementary frameworks: ATFAA - Advanced Threat Framework for Autonomous AI Agents, which organizes agent-specific risks, and SHIELD, a framework proposing practical mitigation strategies designed to reduce enterprise exposure. While this work builds on existing work in LLM and AI security, the focus is squarely on what makes agents different and why those differences matter. Ultimately, this research argues that GenAI agents require a new lens for security.
