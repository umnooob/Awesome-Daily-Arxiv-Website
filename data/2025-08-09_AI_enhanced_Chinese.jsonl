This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance.

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from \\textit{Discours de la méthode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically, LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified responses.

Alignment measures applied to AI/ML workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in company leadership despite existing imbalances.

To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning.

In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm, enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically balancing retrieval breadth and precision.

As AI systems begin to exhaust high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the bottleneck from data curation to reward curation.

While existing methods achieve strong performance through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot benchmarks.

Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However, our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests. This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2) Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels across regions for equitable decision-making.

While the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG (HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo.

However, they often consider each tool independently, overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval. First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into their representations.
