Traditional text-based methods cannot handle visual-related information.

As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model reasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex reasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact with search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning trajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual optimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of RL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely incorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token allocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models interact with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant information due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space tailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling, allowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the retriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query rewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward.

Additionally, we introduce an even faster approximate version of Foreplan. Moreover, Foreplan identifies how many objects an agent should act on to achieve a certain task given restrictions.

Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user, and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning, to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers.

We present a robust framework for sentiment simulation using generative AI agents embedded with psychologically rich profiles. Agents are instantiated from a nationally representative survey of 2,485 Filipino respondents, combining sociodemographic information with validated constructs of personality traits, values, beliefs, and socio-political attitudes. The framework includes three stages: (1) agent embodiment via categorical or contextualized encodings, (2) exposure to real-world political and economic scenarios, and (3) generation of sentiment ratings accompanied by explanatory rationales. Using Quadratic Weighted Accuracy (QWA), we evaluated alignment between agent-generated and human responses. Contextualized encoding achieved 92% alignment in replicating original survey responses. In sentiment simulation tasks, agents reached 81%--86% accuracy against ground truth sentiment, with contextualized profile encodings significantly outperforming categorical (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.70).

Once a good appears, the value each agent has for it is revealed and it must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to one of the agents. It is known that without any assumptions about the values being severely restricted or coming from a distribution, very strong impossibility results hold in this setting. To bypass the latter, we turn our attention to instances where the valuation functions are restricted. In particular, we study personalized $2$-value instances, where there are only two possible values each agent may have for each good, possibly different across agents, and we show how to obtain worst case guarantees with respect to well-known fairness notions, such as maximin share fairness and envy-freeness up to one (or two) good(s). We suggest a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $1/(2n-1)$-MMS allocation at every time step and show that this is the best possible any deterministic algorithm can achieve if one cares about every single time step; nevertheless, eventually the allocation constructed by our algorithm becomes a $1/4$-MMS allocation. To achieve this, the algorithm implicitly maintains a fragile system of priority levels for all agents. Further, we show that, by allowing some limited access to future information, it is possible to have stronger results with less involved approaches. By knowing the values of goods for $n-1$ time steps into the future, we design a matching-based algorithm that achieves an EF$1$ allocation every $n$ time steps, while always maintaining an EF$2$ allocation.

However, they overlook critical developer workflows such as Version Control System (VCS) operations. To address this issue, we present GitGoodBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agent performance on VCS tasks. GitGoodBench covers three core Git scenarios extracted from permissive open-source Python, Java, and Kotlin repositories. Our benchmark provides three datasets: a comprehensive evaluation suite (900 samples), a rapid prototyping version (120 samples), and a training corpus (17,469 samples). We establish baseline performance on the prototyping version of our benchmark using GPT-4o equipped with custom tools, achieving a 21.11% solve rate overall. We expect GitGoodBench to serve as a crucial stepping stone toward truly comprehensive SE agents that go beyond mere programming.", "subjects": "Software Engineering (cs.SE); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": "Short Paper, 5 pages", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22583.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22583", "categories": ["Software Engineering (cs.SE)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent", "agentic"]}

In this report, we introduce FastTD3, a simple, fast, and capable RL algorithm that significantly speeds up training for humanoid robots in popular suites such as HumanoidBench, IsaacLab, and MuJoCo Playground. Our recipe is remarkably simple: we train an off-policy TD3 agent with several modifications -- parallel simulation, large-batch updates, a distributional critic, and carefully tuned hyperparameters. FastTD3 solves a range of HumanoidBench tasks in under 3 hours on a single A100 GPU, while remaining stable during training. We also provide a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of FastTD3 to accelerate RL research in robotics.", "subjects": "Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "comments": "", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22642.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22642", "categories": ["Robotics (cs.RO)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Machine Learning (cs.LG)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"]}
