MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8 fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling.

However, their ability to interpret human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While prior work has simulated LLM \"personas\" using discrete Big Five labels on social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning.

However, the former struggles to generate reliable actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges, we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon environments.

It allows LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs. InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting 13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.", "subjects": "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "comments": "35 pages including appendix", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12263.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12263", "categories": ["Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Machine Learning (cs.LG)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "InPhyRe 是首个评估大型多模态模型在归纳物理推理方面能力的基准，发现模型在处理违反训练中物理定律的场景时表现不佳，并存在语言偏见。", "motivation": "解决大型多模态模型在安全关键应用中无法像人类一样适应未知物理环境进行推理的问题，现有基准仅评估参数知识而非归纳推理能力。", "method": "提出 InPhyRe 基准，使用算法生成的合成碰撞视频，通过视觉问答任务评估 13 个大型多模态模型的归纳物理推理能力。", "result": "模型在应用参数知识进行推理时困难，当演示样本违反物理定律时归纳推理弱，且存在语言偏见，忽视视觉输入。", "conclusion": "大型多模态模型在归纳物理推理方面不可靠，质疑其视觉输入的信任度，需改进以用于安全关键应用。"}}

In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.

Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However, prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations. Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model.

The typical approach, where a policy and vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme distribution shifts.

The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently outperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of 79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT.

Finance is a particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex, multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate. We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70 professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products) on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy. DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset.

The success of such attacks heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework, called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack effectiveness and stealthiness.", "subjects": "Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13266.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13266", "categories": ["Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出JANUS框架，通过局部和全局约束实现隐蔽的节点注入攻击，提升图神经网络的鲁棒性。", "motivation": "解决现有节点注入攻击方法在隐蔽性方面的不足，如依赖间接指标、忽视全局语义模式，导致局部短视问题。", "method": "使用双重约束框架：局部特征流形对齐和全局结构化潜在变量最大化互信息，通过强化学习优化序列决策过程。", "result": "在多个标准数据集上，JANUS在攻击效果和隐蔽性方面显著优于现有方法。", "conclusion": "JANUS框架有效提升攻击的隐蔽性和有效性，对图神经网络安全有重要意义。"}}
