This work proposes a hybrid architecture combining low-level Model Predictive Controller (MPC) with locally deployed Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance decision-making and Human Machine Interaction (HMI). The DecisionxLLM module evaluates robotic state information against natural language instructions to ensure adherence to desired driving behavior. The MPCxLLM module then adjusts MPC parameters based on LLM-generated insights, achieving control adaptability while preserving the safety and constraint guarantees of traditional MPC systems. Further, to enable efficient on-board deployment and to eliminate dependency on cloud connectivity, we shift processing to the on-board computing platform: We propose an approach that exploits Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, and quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that these enhancements yield significant improvements in reasoning accuracy by up to 10.45%, control adaptability by as much as 52.2%, and up to 10.5x increase in computational efficiency (tokens/s), validating the proposed framework's practicality for real-time deployment even on down-scaled robotic platforms.

Kim", "Youngjae Kim"], "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.", "subjects": "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11765.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11765", "categories": ["Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)"], "matching_keywords": ["@RAG"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种共享磁盘KV缓存管理方法Shared RAG-DCache，用于减少RAG增强的大型语言模型(LLMs)多实例推理中的时间到第一个令牌(TTFT)，通过利用磁盘基础的KV缓存减轻预填充阶段的计算负担，并在实验中展示了吞吐量和延迟的显著改善。", "motivation": "随着输入上下文长度和模型大小的增长，大型语言模型(LLMs)的推理延迟问题日益严重，特别是采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术时，输入令牌数量的显著增加进一步加剧了这一问题，尤其是在预填充阶段导致TTFT延长。", "method": "提出了一种磁盘基础的共享KV缓存管理系统Shared RAG-DCache，该系统利用RAG中用户查询相关文档的局部性以及LLM推理服务中的排队延迟，主动生成并存储查询相关文档的磁盘KV缓存，并在多个LLM实例间共享以提高推理性能。", "result": "在配备2个GPU和1个CPU的单主机实验中，Shared RAG-DCache实现了吞吐量15~71%的增加和延迟12~65%的降低，具体取决于资源配置。", "conclusion": "Shared RAG-DCache通过有效的磁盘KV缓存管理和资源共享，显著提高了RAG增强的LLMs在多实例服务环境中的推理性能，为解决长输入上下文和模型增长带来的延迟问题提供了可行方案。"}}

Heath"], "abstract": "Motivated by collaborative reinforcement learning (RL) and optimization with time-correlated data, we study a generic federated stochastic approximation problem involving $M$ agents, where each agent is characterized by an agent-specific (potentially nonlinear) local operator. The goal is for the agents to communicate intermittently via a server to find the root of the average of the agents' local operators. The generality of our setting stems from allowing for (i) Markovian data at each agent and (ii) heterogeneity in the roots of the agents' local operators. The limited recent work that has accounted for both these features in a federated setting fails to guarantee convergence to the desired point or to show any benefit of collaboration; furthermore, they rely on projection steps in their algorithms to guarantee bounded iterates. Our work overcomes each of these limitations. We develop a novel algorithm titled \\texttt{FedHSA}, and prove that it guarantees convergence to the correct point, while enjoying an $M$-fold linear speedup in sample-complexity due to collaboration. To our knowledge, \\emph{this is the first finite-time result of its kind}, and establishing it (without relying on a projection step) entails a fairly intricate argument that accounts for the interplay between complex temporal correlations due to Markovian sampling, multiple local steps to save communication, and the drift-effects induced by heterogeneous local operators. Our results have implications for a broad class of heterogeneous federated RL problems (e.g., policy evaluation and control) with function approximation, where the agents' Markov decision processes can differ in their probability transition kernels and reward functions.", "subjects": "Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)", "comments": null, "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11645.pdf", "abstract_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11645", "categories": ["Machine Learning (cs.LG)", "Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "Systems and Control (eess.SY)", "Optimization and Control (math.OC)"], "matching_keywords": ["agent"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文研究了一个涉及M个代理的通用联邦随机逼近问题，旨在通过间歇性通信找到代理本地操作平均值的根。提出了一种新算法FedHSA，证明了其正确收敛性，并展示了由于协作带来的样本复杂度线性加速。", "motivation": "解决在马尔可夫采样和异构本地操作根的情况下，联邦设置中的协作强化学习和优化问题，克服现有工作中的局限性。", "method": "开发了一种名为FedHSA的新算法，无需依赖投影步骤，考虑了马尔可夫采样的时间相关性、多局部步骤以节省通信及异构本地操作引起的漂移效应。", "result": "FedHSA算法保证了向正确点的收敛，并由于协作实现了样本复杂度的M倍线性加速。", "conclusion": "这是首次在不依赖投影步骤的情况下，证明了此类有限时间结果，对一类广泛的异构联邦RL问题具有 implications。"}}

This knowledge goes beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions, understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout, and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal approach against a non-causal baseline.
